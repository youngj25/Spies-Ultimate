# Spies
My Version of Code name Spies with Anime, Cartoon and Video Games References

## Goal:
Recreate the Code name game with refernces to Anime, Cartoon and Video Games. Additionally, to allow a scaleable version in a way that a player can choose for a game of (4x4) -> (8x8) to increase the difficulty or possibility allow for more groups of people. A couple other nice additions would allow for players to toggle topics, an example would be a person not really knowing much about anime, turning off the anime references. Other possible future features include timer option, an abudanct amount of references in each catergory, additional categories (like DC or Animals), remove/lessen pedestrians and increase assassins.
