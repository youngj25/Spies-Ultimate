# Spies
My Version of Codename with additional various categories such as Anime, Cartoon and Video Games

# Features Implicated
* Timer
  * So then players can have a set standard of how long a player can take

## Goal:
Recreate the card game, 'Codename' with refernces to Anime, Cartoon and Video Games. An option for players to toggle topics, an example would be a person not really knowing much about anime, turning off the anime references. Other possible future features include timer option, an abudanct amount of references in each catergory, additional categories (like DC or Animals), remove/lessen pedestrians and increase assassins. 

In the future, I intend to make a scaleable version for players to complete via phone. Additional,  would like to add a option for players to chose for a game size between (4x4) -> (8x8) at the moment the only available game size is 6x4.
